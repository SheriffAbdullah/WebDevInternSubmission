# Namma Kaloori Educational Website

A simple HTML/CSS educational platform created during 1st Semester at University.

Demo site: [namma-kaloori.surge.sh](https://namma-kaloori.surge.sh)

This is a basic educational website I created during my 1st semester at University. It's a straightforward attempt at building a simple web platform for sharing study materials and course information. I recently hosted it using Surge.

## Features
- Course video previews
- College review video embeds
- Study material links
- Donation form (non-functional)
- Founder information section

## Notes
- This is a static site with limited functionality.
- Most links and buttons are placeholders.
- External resources (like study materials) are stored on OneDrive.
- The site is far from perfect, but it represents my first steps in web development.
